# ===============================================================================
# Go Experiment Documentation
# ===============================================================================

# GreenTeaGC üçµ
# -------------
# New garbage collector with redesigned allocator
# Go Doc: go doc runtime/internal/sys.GOEXPERIMENT | grep -A2 GreenTeaGC
#
# Advantages:
#   - 10-40% reduction in GC overhead  
#   - Lower pause times and better throughput
#   - Reduced memory fragmentation
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - May use slightly more memory initially
#   - Different performance characteristics might affect existing tuning
#   - Still experimental, may have undiscovered edge cases

# JSONv2 üì¶
# ---------
# Complete JSON package rewrite with improved performance
# Go Doc: go doc encoding/json/v2 (when available)
#
# Advantages:
#   - Better performance (faster marshal/unmarshal operations)
#   - Native streaming support for large JSON documents
#   - More detailed error messages with location information
#   - More configuration options for customization
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Different API from json v1 (requires code changes)
#   - May break existing JSON handling assumptions
#   - Some third-party libraries may not be compatible

# BoringCrypto üîê
# ---------------
# Uses BoringSSL for FIPS 140-2 compliance
# Go Doc: go doc crypto/internal/boring
#
# Advantages:
#   - FIPS 140-2 certification for government/enterprise requirements
#   - Validated cryptographic implementation
#   - Consistent crypto behavior across platforms
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Larger binary size (includes BoringSSL)
#   - Limited to specific crypto algorithms (no custom crypto)
#   - Slower than Go's native crypto implementation
#   - CGO dependency required

# NewInliner ‚ö°
# ------------
# Improved function inlining heuristics for better optimization
# Go Doc: go doc cmd/compile/internal/inline
#
# Advantages:
#   - Better performance (5-10% improvement in many cases)
#   - Smarter inlining decisions based on cost/benefit analysis
#   - Reduced function call overhead
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Larger binary size from more aggressive inlining
#   - Different optimization patterns may affect existing benchmarks
#   - May increase compile time

# FieldTrack üìä
# -------------
# Tracks struct field usage for dead code elimination
# Go Doc: go doc cmd/compile | grep -A2 fieldtrack
#
# Advantages:
#   - Dead code elimination for unused struct fields
#   - Smaller binary sizes
#   - Better cache locality from reduced struct sizes
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Build time overhead for analysis
#   - May break reflection-heavy code that accesses fields dynamically
#   - Incompatible with some code generation tools

# CgoCheck2 üîç
# ------------
# Stricter cgo pointer checking for memory safety
# Go Doc: go doc runtime.SetCgoCheck
#
# Advantages:
#   - Catches more cgo safety violations at runtime
#   - Prevents memory corruption from incorrect pointer passing
#   - Better debugging of cgo-related crashes
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Runtime overhead for all cgo calls
#   - May reject previously working (but unsafe) code
#   - Performance impact on cgo-heavy applications

# Synctest üß™
# -----------
# Deterministic concurrent testing framework
# Go Doc: go doc internal/synctest (Go 1.24+)
#
# Advantages:
#   - Reproducible concurrent test execution
#   - Easier debugging of race conditions
#   - Deterministic test failures for CI/CD
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Tests run slower due to synchronization
#   - Not representative of production timing behavior
#   - May hide real-world race conditions

# Dwarf5 üêõ
# ---------
# Modern DWARF v5 debug format
# Go Doc: go doc debug/dwarf
#
# Advantages:
#   - Better debugging experience with more metadata
#   - Smaller debug info sections (10-20% reduction)
#   - Improved support for optimized code debugging
#
# Disadvantages:
#   - Older debuggers (GDB < 10, LLDB < 14) incompatible
#   - Some profiling tools may not support DWARF v5
#   - Platform-specific debugger issues possible
